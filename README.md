***Just in case***: Short clip of me building and running this app on my machine is [here](https://youtu.be/WQ9RHzuD0V4 )

## Getting started

Make sure that `cmake` and `qt5` are installed. Otherwise the project won't build succesfully.

## Building

1. Clone or download this repository

3. Run these commands:

   `cd Dict_Search/dSearch`

   `cmake .`

   `make`

If these commands finish successfully, an executable will be created.

4. Start application by running:
